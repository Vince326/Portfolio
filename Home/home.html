            <div class="aboutParagraph">
                <p> Hi, I'm a software engineer who's always eager to learn and improve his craft to be the best
                    engineer I possibly can. I'm
                    currently skilled in Full-stack web development using the PERN Stack.
                <div>
                    <p>One of my professional goals is to keep expanding my knowledge by
                        working on developing mobile apps, and even get into project management.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <p>In my spare time, I like to
                        listen to podcasts,
                        watch stand-up comedy, mixed martial arts and anime as well as study more skills and
                        technologies.
                        I'm someone who'll commit to solving a problem and am not afraid to seek help if I don't know
                        the answer.
                    <div>
                        <p>I believe communication and planning are important in solving a problem as
                            well as knowing what the right questions to ask. Building this website wasn't too easy but
                            if I
                            can build this, I can build anything!</p>
